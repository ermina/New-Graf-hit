# grafhit-www

A revamped version of the grafhit.net website featuring: 
- real-time "now playing" data thanks to websockets
- mobile friendly interface
- an actually usable audio player


# TODO

- integrate piwik stats tracking
- add a reception contour on the map
- searching for a title : return most recent one if results empty
- adjust visual details (reverse bg, fonts, blocks margins/transparent bg, colors)
- audio player : link to source when file playing
- program grid : adjust view
